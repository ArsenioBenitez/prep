    Chapter 3 is about how we can get make our visualizations more truthful. Vizualizations are models. Models are signs or sets of signs that describes or 
    explains or predicts something about how nature works. A good visualization should not over-simplify information. They need to clarify
    it. When doing so, we must keep in mind that the audience will form their own interpretation of the information we present them which is an opportunity for misinterpretations.
    People are prone to misinterpretations and mistakes due to 3 mind bugs in the human mind:
    1. The patternicity bug - detecting patterns regardless of if they're real of not.
    2. The storytelling bug - once we detect patterns, we tend to come up with an explanation for those patterns
    3. The confirmation bug -  any further information recieved confirms our explanation for certain patterns.
