    <pre>My purpose is being a good rolemodel for my younger sister as she prepares to enter college.
      I will collect data on the number of minority women in college and stem fields.
      The 2010 Federal STEM Education Inventory Data Set contains information about the people in stem fields.
      The Postsecondary Education Participants System maintains eligibility, certification, demographic, financial, review, audit, and default rate data about school.
      This will be helpful in finding the number of women in post secondary education.
