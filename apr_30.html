    A few misconceptions about women in STEM fields are:
    1. That women's abilities in STEM are inferior to men.
    2. That women are less interested in STEM than men.
    3. That success in STEM requires natural STEM talent.
    
    There is significant research that debunks those misconceptions and I can also speak from experience in
    my STEM classes at Centre. There may be certain facts such as women leaders in STEM that contribute to these misconceptions
    and society could adopt these misconceptions as facts which in turn keeps women away from STEM fields. As far as the natural talent
    arguement, earlier in the semester we talked about a growth mindset, therefore we know learning and intelligence isn't stagnant. 
    With effort, anybody can increase their abilities. 
    I will debunk these misconceptions in my visualization by showing average GPAs for men and women in STEM majors (debunks 1). 
    I will also try to find data that correlates hard work and effort to GPA (debunks 3). I am still brainstorming ideas for debunking
    2 so if you have any suggestions, let me know!
