      A force layout allows you to connect nodes with edges.
      The nodes are elements of your data and the edges represent the connections between the nodes.
      Three datasets that would be great if represented using a force layout are:
      1) Family trees: each person would be a node and the relationships the edges.
      2) Matroids: the graphiods of matroids from descrete math would be better represented in 3D.
        link for more info on matroids: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid#Graphoids">wikipedia</a>
      3) Molecules or Models of biological cellular structures and activity. For example, glucose has a chemical formula of C6H12O6, we could show how each carbon connect to make a carbon ring, etc.
