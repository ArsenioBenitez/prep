  <p>Being a first generation, hispanic student, I feel driven to be a role model for my younger sister. <br> As a woman, she faces additional adversities and I want to show her is possible and remind her that although the odds may be against her, she should always keep persistent. <br>
  The data provided shows the percent of women in three stem fields. My sister is a senior in highschool and has a desire to study stem in college. </p>
